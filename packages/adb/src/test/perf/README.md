# Merkle Tree Performance Test

This directory contains a performance testing script for the Merkle Tree `addFile` operation.

## Overview

The performance test (`test-merkle-performance.ts`) measures:
- Average time to add a file to the merkle tree
- How performance scales as more files are added (1-1000 files)
- Statistical analysis of add times (min, max, median, percentiles)
- Performance trend analysis to determine algorithmic complexity

## Running the Test

```bash
cd packages/adb
bun run src/test/perf/test-merkle-performance.ts
```

## Comparing Performance Results

The test automatically saves detailed performance data to JSON files for tracking changes over time:

### Baseline Performance
A baseline performance file (`baseline-performance.json`) captures the current implementation's performance with 100,000 files for reference comparisons.

### Auto-compare latest two results:
```bash
bun run src/test/perf/compare-results.ts
```

### Compare specific result files:
```bash
bun run src/test/perf/compare-results.ts 2024-10-15T10-30-00-000Z.json 2024-10-15T11-45-00-000Z.json
```

## JSON Output Format

Each test run saves comprehensive performance data including:

- **Metadata**: Timestamp, test configuration, system info
- **Overall Stats**: Mean, median, percentiles, total time
- **Scaling Analysis**: Quarter comparisons, scaling ratio, classification
- **Performance Trends**: Detailed breakdown every 5% of files
- **Scale Points**: Performance at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of files
- **Tree Stats**: Node count, structure efficiency

Example output structure:
```json

  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-10-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "totalFiles": 100000,

  },
  "scaling": {
    "scalingRatio": 7.34,
    "classification": "poor"
  }
  // ... additional detailed data
}
```

## Test Details

The test:
1. Creates an empty merkle tree
2. Generates 1000 random files with varying sizes (1KB-100KB)
3. Adds each file individually while measuring the time
4. Analyzes performance trends and scaling characteristics

## Expected Output

The script provides:
- Real-time progress updates every 100 files
- Comprehensive statistics (mean, median, percentiles)
- Performance trend analysis by file count segments
- Scaling analysis to determine if performance is O(log n) or worse
- Final tree statistics

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Scaling
- **Green (🟢)**: Scaling ratio < 1.5x → Good O(log n) performance
- **Yellow (🟡)**: Scaling ratio 1.5-3x → Moderate scaling
- **Red (🔴)**: Scaling ratio > 3x → Poor scaling, possibly O(n)

### Key Metrics
- **Mean time**: Average time per file addition
- **Scaling ratio**: Performance difference between first 250 and last 250 files
- **95th/99th percentile**: Worst-case performance bounds

## Benchmark Results

### Test Run: 100,000 Files (October 2024)

### Performance Summary (Optimized Binary Tree Implementation)

- **Average file addition time**: 0.24ms (240 microseconds) - **73% improvement**
- **Throughput**: ~4,200 files/second - **275% improvement**
- **Scaling factor**: 7.96x (still O(n) characteristics, but much faster)
- **Memory efficiency**: 199,999 nodes for 100,000 files (balanced tree structure)
- **Total test duration**: 23.8 seconds - **73% faster**

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Original (Array-based) | Optimized (Binary Tree) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Mean add time | 0.89ms | 0.24ms | **73% faster** |
| Throughput | 1,119 files/sec | 4,200 files/sec | **275% faster** |
| Total duration | 89.3s | 23.8s | **73% faster** |
| Scaling ratio | 7.41x | 7.96x | Similar (still O(n)) |

The optimized binary tree implementation shows dramatic performance improvements across all metrics. While the scaling characteristics remain O(n) due to the tree balancing algorithm, the absolute performance is significantly better, making it much more practical for large-scale operations.
