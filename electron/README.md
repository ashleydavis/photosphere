# Photosphere Electron

The Electron-based desktop version of [the Photosphere application](https://rapidfullstackdevelopment.com/example-application).

## Pre-reqs

To run the Electron version of Photosphere you must first run [the backend](../backend/README.md).

## Setup

First, follow the instructions in [the main readme](../README.md).

Then open a terminal and change directory to the Electron project:

```bash
cd electron
```

## Run from the dev server

If you are running the Electron frontend in dev mode, start the Electron app like this:

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

This command also starts the dev server.
