# Cursor Rules

## Code Style Guidelines

### DO NOT create import-and-reexport patterns

**NEVER** create patterns like this:
```typescript
// In file A.ts
export { functionFromB } from "./B";
```

**Why:** This creates unnecessary indirection and makes it harder to find where functions are actually defined. It also creates circular dependency risks and makes refactoring more difficult.

**Instead:** 
- Export functions directly from their source files
- If you need to expose them from a package's main index, add them there directly:
  ```typescript
  // In packages/api/src/index.ts
  export { functionFromB } from "./lib/B";
  ```

**Exception:** Only use re-exports when creating a public API from a package's main index file (like `packages/api/src/index.ts`), and only export from subdirectories/modules, not from peer files at the same level.

## Critical Workflow Rules

### NEVER finish up until all code is compiling

**ALWAYS** run `bun run c` on the entire project before considering work complete. Do not assume the code compiles just because the linter shows no errors. TypeScript compilation may catch errors that the linter doesn't.

**Before marking any task as complete:**
1. Run `bun run c` to compile the entire project
2. Fix any compilation errors
3. Only then consider the work done
